# SimpleEmptyFolderFinder

This is just a simple little Python program I wrote up that finds all empty child folders in either the directory you put it in, or in a directory you provide.

As it scans, it prints of the directories, and once it finishes, it lists how many directories in total it had scanned and how many were empty (no files and no folders).
